# ElevateLabs_Task6
Understand and implement KNN for classification problems.
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using **Python** and **scikit-learn** on a classification dataset. The goal is to understand KNN behavior, experiment with different values of K, and visualize decision boundaries.

## Steps

1. **Choose a Classification Dataset**  
   - You can use datasets like **Iris**, **Wine**, or any other classification dataset.
   - Features are normalized to ensure equal contribution to distance calculations.

2. **Normalize Features**  
   - Normalization/Standardization is applied using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.

3. **Use KNeighborsClassifier**  
   - Import and fit the model using `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn.neighbors`.

4. **Experiment with Different Values of K**  
   - Test multiple K values to observe model performance.
   - Use cross-validation or validation set to choose the optimal K.

5. **Evaluate Model**  
   - Calculate **accuracy** of predictions.
   - Generate a **confusion matrix** using `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` for detailed analysis.

6. **Visualize Decision Boundaries**  
   - Plot decision boundaries to understand how KNN classifies different regions.
   - Use `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization.

## Key Concepts

- **KNN Algorithm**: Lazy, non-parametric method for classification and regression.
- **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan, or other metrics define “closeness.”
- **Normalization**: Important to prevent features with larger scales from dominating distance calculations.
- **K Value**: Determines the number of neighbors considered; affects bias-variance tradeoff.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`

## Results

- Optimal K value determined by accuracy.
- Confusion matrix highlights classification performance for each class.
- Decision boundary visualization shows how KNN separates different classes.
